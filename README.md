- 👋 Hi, I’m @AK-SCM
- 👀 I’m interested in Supply Chain Management.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R-Programming for building forecasting models.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning and solving Supply Chain Problems
- 📫 You can reach me at akhil.chilukuri@outlook.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have no prior coding experience and knowledge, just starting right now, any help and guidance would be greatly appreciated.
-  For a long time I have always thought as an aspirational SCM professional who is just starting, I've thought coding is not my forte and do not need it. Boy! Was I wrong and how?
